> A modern, fast, and simple open-source blogging platform that puts creators in control.

## About Plume

Plume is an open-source blogging platform built with Laravel and Livewire, designed to be a modern alternative to traditional blogging software like WordPress. We believe that creators should have full ownership and control over their content, without being locked into proprietary platforms or complex systems.

Our vision is to provide a clean, intuitive blogging experience that focuses on what matters most: writing and sharing your ideas with the world. Plume is built for simplicity and performance, making it easy for anyone to set up and maintain their own blog while maintaining complete control over their data and presentation.

While we're excited about the potential for a hosted SaaS version in the future, this repository focuses on the open-source project that anyone can self-host. We're committed to building a platform that serves both individual creators and the broader open-source community.

## Features

- **Modern Tech Stack**: Built with Laravel and Livewire for a responsive, dynamic experience
- **Clean Design**: Minimalist interface that puts content first
- **Self-Hosted**: Complete control over your data and infrastructure
- **Open Source**: Transparent, community-driven development
- **Fast & Lightweight**: Optimized for performance and simplicity

## Roadmap Coming Soon

We're currently in the early stages of development and working hard to get Plume to a stable, usable state. Our roadmap will be published soon, outlining the features and improvements we have planned for upcoming releases.

## Contributing

We're excited to welcome contributors once Plume reaches a working state! As we're still in active development, we're focusing on getting the core functionality solid before opening up for community contributions. 

When we're ready, we'll provide clear guidelines for:
- Setting up a development environment
- Understanding our codebase architecture
- Contributing to features and bug fixes
- Code style and review processes

Stay tuned for updates on when we'll be ready to accept contributions!
