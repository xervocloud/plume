# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability in Plume, please follow these steps:

1. **Do NOT create a public GitHub issue** for security vulnerabilities
2. **Email us directly** at security@xervo.cloud
3. **Include detailed information** about the vulnerability:
   - Description of the issue
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Any suggested fixes (if you have them)

## What to expect

- You'll receive an acknowledgment within 48 hours
- We'll investigate and provide updates on our progress
- Once fixed, we'll credit you in our security advisory (unless you prefer to remain anonymous)
- We'll release a patch as soon as possible

## Responsible Disclosure

We appreciate security researchers who:
- Give us reasonable time to fix issues before public disclosure
- Avoid accessing or modifying user data
- Test only on your own accounts or with explicit permission
- Follow responsible disclosure practices

## Security Updates

Security updates will be released as patch versions (e.g., 1.0.1, 1.0.2) and will be clearly marked in our release notes.

Thank you for helping keep Plume secure!
