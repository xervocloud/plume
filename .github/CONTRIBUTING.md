# Contributing to Plume

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Plume! This document provides guidelines and information for contributors.

## Current Status

**Note**: Plume is currently in early development and we're not yet accepting contributions. We're working hard to get the core functionality solid before opening up for community contributions.

## What We're Building

Plume is an open-source blogging platform built with Laravel and Livewire. Our goal is to create a modern, fast, and simple alternative to traditional blogging software that gives creators full ownership of their content.

## How to Help (For Now)

While we're not ready for code contributions yet, you can help by:

- **Starring the repository** to show your interest
- **Watching for updates** to stay informed about our progress
- **Sharing feedback** through GitHub Discussions (coming soon)
- **Reporting bugs** once we have a working version
- **Suggesting features** that would be valuable to creators

## What's Coming

Once Plume reaches a stable, working state, we'll provide:

- **Development setup guide** with step-by-step instructions
- **Architecture documentation** explaining how Plume works
- **Contributing guidelines** for different types of contributions
- **Code style guide** to maintain consistency
- **Review process** for pull requests

## Stay Connected

- **GitHub Discussions**: Coming soon for community conversations
